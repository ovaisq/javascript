# Send SMS with React and Twilio

This is an example of sending SMS using React and Twilio. This borrows heavily from Phil Nash's example (see LICENSE)

## Running the project

To run the project you will need a Twilio account and a Twilio phone number that can send SMS messages. Gather your Twilio Account Sid and Auth Token from the [Twilio console](https://www.twilio.com/console) and the phone number.

Install the dependencies.

```bash
npm i
```

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your Twilio credentials and phone number.

Start the application on its own with the command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
